# STarBar
## A Mac Menu Bar App for controlling your SmartThings Hub

:zap: This is a work in progress, thanks for your patience! :zap:

This project makes use of the [homebridge-smartthings 'JSON Complete API'](https://github.com/pdlove/homebridge-smartthings) application for the SmartThings hub. Please follow the instructions to install that, and then place the 'app_id' and 'access_token' codes in the Connection Information window of STarBar. To get this information, open SmartThings on your phone, goto "My Home">"SmartApps">"JSON Complete API" and tap on Config.
